# Talks by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)

This is a list of links recordings/slides from talks that I've given at meetups and conferences (starting from most recent).

For all the talks I have on YouTube, I add the video to [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV5CVI1eNcJgNqzNwcs4UKrlJdhfDjshf).

You might also be interested in my [appearances](https://github.com/kentcdodds/appearances).

## Conference Talks

### More than you want to know about ES6 Modules

[MidwestJS 2016](http://midwestjs.com/)

[slides](https://slides.com/kentcdodds/es6-modules)

Abstract:

> ES6 Modules have been standardized and many have already started using them. They have a lot of benefits over CommonJS, AMD, and Globals.
> Unfortunately, there are many ways to deal with modules with this new syntax and it can be a bit confusing. In this talk, we'll explore the different ways you can use the new syntax and when you'd use the different methods. We'll also investigate what's going on at a high level. Buckle up for a firehose of ES6 information.

### Testing React

[MidwestJS 2016](http://midwestjs.com/)

Abstract:

> I hope you're excited about testing! We all know we need to get testing better, but it can be really hard to know how and what to test. We'll learn about the three inputs to React components (user input, props, and data) and how to test for each of them. You'll discover that if you slightly modify the way you're writing your components, you can make them much easier to test. We'll be using the new super fast AVA testing framework and even see how to add code coverage with nyc.

> I hope you like code. You're gonna see some here!

### Transform your code like Optimus Prime: ASTs for Beginners

[KCDC 2016](http://www.kcdc.info/)

[slides](https://slides.com/kentcdodds/a-beginners-guide-to-asts) | [code](http://kcd.im/beginner-asts-code) | [video](https://youtu.be/WO7H2NHmN18) (from a [BeMyApp](http://events.bemyapp.com/) [event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/transform-your-code-like-optimus-prime-asts-for-beginners-wkent-c-dodds-tickets-26281147620))

Abstract:

> The Abstract Syntax Tree. It sounds a lot worse than it is. It’s actually quite simple and enables some powerful tools. BabelJS uses it to transform your code from ES.Next to ES5. ESLint uses it to lint your code. And with a knowledge of how it works, you can extend these and other tools to do some mind bustingly powerful things. Prepare to be amazed by ASTs!

### Managing an Open Source Project

[Space City JS 2016](http://spacecity.codes/)

[video](https://youtu.be/jKI1Kj5VXqE) (practice run at a meetup) | [slides](http://kcd.im/manage-oss)

Abstract:

> Awesome! You’ve made it big! You’ve published an open source project and people are actually using it to make the world a better place. Achievement unlocked! Great job! But wait… what’s this? An issue? Oh, it’s just a bug. Pretty quick and easy. Fixed, released, done, #likeaboss 😎. What’s this? A PR? How cool! Wait… That’s not quite right… Oh, a question! Cool! And another! And another… eh… and another… Uh oh… I think I’ve just sold my soul to this project.
>
> You start an open source project to scratch your own itch and suddenly other people start using it and they need your help. This can easily start eating up your time big time and before you know it, your kids start feeling neglected.
>
> I’ve had to deal with this in a few projects and I’ve learned a thing or two about work/life/oss balance. I have a few tricks that help you make the project manage itself a bit more while still being friendly and helpful to users of the project.

### The First Pull Request

[Fluent Conf 2016](http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/schedule/detail/46612)

[video](https://youtu.be/HjgZQeMrw6c) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/1st-pr)

Abstract:

> "Feel free to submit a pull request." For some, this is a welcome invitation, but for many developers, pull requests are intimidating, discouraging them from contributing to the community. Kent Dodds demonstrates how easy and fun it is to create a pull request as a first timer.
> 
> To open source newcomers
> You, open source newcomer, can be a valuable contributor to the open source community. We need you here. We want your input and contributions. But getting over that initial hump of contributing can be a real challenge. I call this the first-timer's dilemma. You want to contribute, but you don't know how, or you're afraid your pull request (PR) won't get merged. You'll learn that it's less frightening and easier to get started than you think, as you become familiar with the common patterns and processes you need to understand in order to contribute to an open source project.
> 
> To open source project maintainers
> You, open source project maintainer, are the lifeblood of the open source community. Developers power open source. The more people finding, reporting, and fixing bugs or adding/removing features the better. You have the power to help newcomers overcome the first-timer's dilemma. You'll see what challenges first-timers often face and how with just a few extra minutes of your time, you can help tear down these barriers and make your project more friendly to contributors (including first-timers).
> 
> Whether you'e new to open source or a pro, Kent will help you as we strive to make the open source community more open and friendly.

### What we can learn about testing from the wheel

[Ignite Fluent 2016](http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/schedule/detail/48271)

[video](https://youtu.be/Da9wfQ0frGA) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxZDtibcRzVWNFU3VXM2RzJ1SG8/view?usp=sharing)

Abstract:

> Knowing what and how to test is almost more difficult than actually writing the test. If you write only end-to-end tests, you'll struggle with reliability and speed. If you write only unit tests, you'll struggle with surprising bugs integrating things together.
> 
> In this ignite talk, we'll take these concepts away from code for a moment to see how we would test a wheel. Prepare for an enlightening, entertaining 5 minutes 😀.

### Zero to 60 in software development: How to jumpstart your career

[Foward 4 Web Summit](http://forwardjs.com/)

[video](https://youtu.be/-qPh6I2hfjw) | [slides](https://slides.com/kentcdodds/zero-to-60)

Abstract:

> Our industry has a problem. We have a "talent shortage," so we're loading the industry with new developers from various bootcamps, but they're having trouble finding jobs because many companies are unwilling to hire and train them. So these new developers are left to themselves to try and find ways to develop the skills they need to be "marketable."
> 
> I graduated from college in April 2014, just shy of two years ago. In that time, I've been able to learn a ton, build a bunch of stuff, teach workshops, create egghead screencasts, speak at conferences, and generally contribute quite a bit to the JavaScript community. In this talk, I'll cover some solid principles of things that I’ve learned in my experience. This will help new-comers to jumpstart their career. And help old-timers know how they can help new-comers.

### A beginner's guide to ASTs

[JS Remote Conf 2016](https://allremoteconfs.com/js-2016)

Same as above...

### How to Open Source Your Stuff

[Angular Remote Conf 2015](http://angularremoteconf.com)

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlu3QvuwruY) | [slides](https://slides.com/kentcdodds/open-sourcing-your-stuff) | [repo 1](https://github.com/kentcdodds/todomvc-angular) | [repo 2](https://github.com/angular-todo-mvc/angular-todo-escape)

Abstract: 

> Modularity is the key to success with large apps. Build things so they work well in isolation, then piece them together to make the full application. One thing that really helps with this kind of strategy is to open source your stuff. In this talk, we'll talk about why you would want to open source your hard earned components. Then we'll take a look at an existing application, identify a good candidate component for open sourcing, and then go through the process of creating an open source project for that component and add it as a project dependency. I hope you like looking at code, because you're going to see a lot of it!

### angular-formly: Abstracting Away Complexity

[MidwestJS 2015](http://midwestjs.com)

[video](https://youtu.be/jUX2zcSwbRE) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/angular-formly) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/angular-formly-convert)

Abstract:

> We're all really tired of writing the same code for every form. You need a label here and an input here and make sure their IDs are the same and unique and now you want me to add validation!? Daah! I got fed up with this pretty quick and found that I enjoy writing JavaScript a lot more than repeating myself with HTML. If you're like me, then you'll love angular-formly. In this talk, we'll see how you can very easily represent your model with a form using a few lines of JavaScript. You want validation, conditional fields, or custom templates? You need to react to changes to a field? Piece of cake. Oh, and are you worried about the upgrade path to Angular 2.0? Let's talk... So come on, and let's make forms less painful and more delightful.

### Angular 2: Built for Huge, Long-lasting Applications

[Philly ETE 2015](http://phillyemergingtech.com/sessions/angularjs-2-0-leveling-up/)

[video](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/angularjs-2) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/ng2-introduction) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ng2-random-user/)

Abstract:

> Angular 2 is built for huge web applications that stand the test of time. To accomplish this, Angular 2 utilizes the latest and greatest web technologies like ES6 modules/classes and Web Components. Come get a preview of what this looks like with Egghead.io instructor Kent C. Dodds as he live codes an application using the pre-release alpha version of Angular 2.

### ng-model-options in 5 minutes

[ng-conf 2015](http://www.ng-conf.org/)

[video](https://youtu.be/k3t3ov6xHDw) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/ng-model-options-in-5-minutes#/) | [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/qocekak/edit) | [blog post](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/ngmodeloptions-total-model-control)

Abstract: 

> Angular 1.3 brought a sweet new directive to the table called ng-model-options. It gives you more control over how your model gets updated and is very easy to use. Get a quick intro and start using this today!

### JSON powered Forms

[ng-nl 2015](http://www.ng-nl.org)

[video](https://youtu.be/o90TMDL3OYc) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/angular-formly) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/angular-formly-convert)

### Using ReactJS with existing AngularJS codebase

[Jfokus 2015](http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/)

[video](https://youtu.be/AiE4ajXh7dY) | [flash video](http://kentcdodds.com/react-in-angular/) :shrug: | [app](http://kentcdodds.com/react-in-angular/app/) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-in-angular)

Abstract:

> ReactJS is an amazing View library that promises (and delivers) high performance, composability, and maintainability. AngularJS is an amazing MV* framework. 
> Tons of shops have adopted and totally bought into AngularJS for their entire frontend application. They're loving it, but some are finding that as these applications get bigger, they can become unwieldy, unperformant, and difficult to reason about. Many of these problems can be solved by doing things better with angular, but not all of them. 
> In this talk, we'll go over why you don't need to re-write your whole application to get some of the wins of React and that it actually is quite easy to integrate the two. We'll talk about where it makes sense to bring in React to an existing Angular codebase and how it works well.

### Intro to AngularJS

### Improving UX with GenieJS

[MidwestJS 2014](http://midwestjs.com/)

[video](https://youtu.be/lqf5mrrf4ZY) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/genie#/) | [workshop](http://kentcdodds.com/genie/workshop/)

Abstract:

> Every time you touch a mouse, a baby seal is ruthlessly tortured and killed. Ok, not really, but I seriously believe that people are so much more productive when they don't need to use the mouse to click on something. One implementation intended to help with this is keyboard shortcuts. Unfortunately, these are limited to the number of sensible keys and key combinations and can be difficult for users to discover, remember, and use. Normally, only super users will ever use them, leaving the rest of your users killing baby seals (ok, seriously, I really don't think that happens...). The goal of genie is to address the problems with keyboard combinations. Genie is a simple library to emulate the same kind of behavior seen in apps like Alfred (for mac: http://alfredapp.com). Essentially, you register actions associated with keywords. Then you can request the genie to perform that action based on the best keyword match for a given keyword. This allows a user to type what they want to have happen and select from a list of the best matches for what they typed to perform an action. Over time, the genie will learn the actions more associated with specific keywords and those will be come first when a list of matching actions is requested. Check it out at http://github.com/kentcdodds/genie

### Learning JavaScript and Staying Marketable

[ng-nebraska meetup November 2015](http://www.meetup.com/ng-nebraska/events/226632455/)

[slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/learning-javascript) | [tweet](https://twitter.com/ngnebraska/status/669319695015673856)

Abstract:

> Angular is amazing and has contributed to a major change in the landscape of frontend web development forever. But frameworks come and go. Even though Angular 1.x will still be around for a few years, it will eventually be totally antiquated and you'll need to show off other kinds of skills to attract employers. What if there were a way that you could learn skills you need to both be effective Angular developers today and develop skills that will make you marketable for many more years to come? Spoiler, I'm talking about JavaScript. Let's go over why that's important and a few ways to accomplish this.

### JWT: Not Your Grandma's Cookies

[AngularJS Utah meetup June](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Utah/events/173788512/)

[video](https://youtu.be/vIGZxeQUUFU?t=1m51s) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/ng-jwt-workshop) | [site](http://kentcdodds.com/ng-jwt-workshop/frontend/) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ng-jwt-workshop)

Abstract:

> Cookies and sessions are the traditional way to keep track of user state on the server, but it can bite you later. JSON WebTokens (JWT) is a stateless way to deal with users. I'll show how to use $httpInterceptors to make this easy as pie. :-)

### Using ReactJS with existing AngularJS codebase

[ReactJS Utah meetup January 2015](http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Utah/events/219204576/)

Abstract:

> If you're not careful (especially with your ng-repeats) your watch count in your app can grow pretty quick. This isn't a problem itself, but its what that does to your digest cycle. Lots of watchers makes your digest cycle take longer. In my talk, we'll talk about what Angular 1.3 is doing to help solve this problem, the problem their solution presents, a solution to that problem, and what can be done for pre-Angular 1.3 code.

## Workshops

### ES6/2016

[Connect.JS 2016](http://connect-js.com/)

> The EcmaScript standard is now on a yearly release cycle. With ES6 complete and ES2016 almost ratified, we have a ton of awesome new features to use in our daily software development. In this training, we'll learn about the features you're likely to use and benefit from on a day-to-day basis. In the afternoon, we'll take an existing application and update it to leverage these features using with modern tools like Babel. My goal is that after this training, you'll be able to go back to your projects and add these tools so you can write ES.next code today.
>
> This is a very hands-on training and you'll need to make sure that you're machine is set up. Please ensure that you have git, Node, npm, and a text editor / IDE installed on your machine. With that, you'll be ready to rock and roll. Feel free to hit me up on twitter if you have any questions.
